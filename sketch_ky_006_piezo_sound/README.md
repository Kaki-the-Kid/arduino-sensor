# KY-006 Piezo - Passive buzzer module

The KY-006 Passive Piezoelectric Buzzer module can produce a range of sound tones depending on the input signal fequency. To generate single-tone sounds use the KY-012 Active Buzzer.

Compatible with popular microcontrollers like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESP32 and others.

## KY-006 SPECIFICATIONS
This module consists of a passive buzzer and 3 male header pins. You can use it generate tones between 1.5 to 2.5kHz by switching it on and off repeatedly at different frequencies either using delays or PWM.

# KY-006 ARDUINO CODE
The following Arduino sketch will generate two different tones by rapidly turning on and off the buzzer at different frequencies using a delay.

```C++
int buzzer = 8; // set the buzzer control digital IO pin

void setup() {
	pinMode(buzzer, OUTPUT); // set pin 8 as output
}

void loop() {
	for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {  // make a sound
		digitalWrite(buzzer, HIGH); // send high signal to buzzer 
		delay(1); // delay 1ms
		digitalWrite(buzzer, LOW); // send low signal to buzzer
		delay(1);
	}

delay(50);
	for (int j = 0; j < 100; j++) { //make another sound
		digitalWrite(buzzer, HIGH);
		delay(2); // delay 2ms
		digitalWrite(buzzer, LOW);
		delay(2);
	}
  
	delay(500);
}
```
